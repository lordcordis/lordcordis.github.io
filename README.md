## About Me
I am an iOS developer with a background in development since 2018 and a focused learning journey since 2022. Before transitioning to iOS development, I worked as a surgeon from 2013 to 2022. My key skills include MVVM architecture, Firebase integration, and utilizing UIKit as a base for building applications with SwiftUI in containers. I am passionate about creating efficient and user-friendly applications.
